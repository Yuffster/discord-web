Discord MMO Client
--------------------------

This is the web client for Discord, a highly expressive, object-based MMO engine written in JavaScript on top of Node.JS and MooTools.

Installation
==========================

**NOTE**: You'll need an instance of the Discord running on the same server.  See [discord-engine](http://github.com/Yuffster/discord-engine.git) for more information.

`git checkout git://github.com/Yuffster/discord-web.git`

`npm install`

`node server.js config.example.json`

Then go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
